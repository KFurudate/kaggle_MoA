Evaluation: log loss

In this competition, we have a dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. 
The data were measured simultaneously human cellsâ€™ responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types.
Our aim is to solve the issue of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug.in this dataset.

  - g- signify gene expression.
  - c- signify cell viability. 
  - cp_type indicates samples treated with a compound (trt_cp) or with a control perturbation (ctl_vehicle); control perturbations have no MoAs.
  - cp_time indicates treatment duration (24, 48, 72 hours) 
  - cp_dose indicate dose (high or low).
